This is a final project to showcase my understanding of HTMl/CSS/JavaScript.  It incorporates all three languages to create a smooth and styled experience for the user.

The first two pages are a todo list app complete with creating a simple profile.  

The last page is a fun and simple gallery app that shows pictures and then flips them and presents them in black and white once hovered over.

Have fun perusing the site.
